This project is inspired by a web I saw lately called [MultiTwitch](https://www.multitwitch.tv/)
Which is a website to be able to watch different twitch streams at the same time.

I really like the idea but not the UX and I saw the project is made with python and the last update was on 2019 so I decided to create my own approach.
You can find the original project [here](https://github.com/bhamrick/multitwitch/tree/master/multitwitch)

## Description

This program will allow you to watch multiple twitch streams at the same time by just typing the streamer name.
Really similar to Twitch Rivals or MultiTwitch,

## How does it works?

The project is being deployed using vercel.
You can find the website [here](https://twitch-teams.vercel.app/)

It is made with Next.js

## Future Plans

- [x] Deployment for online usage.
- [ ] Open twitch stream from user input.
- [ ] Creation of custom lists.
- [ ] Implementation of Buy me a coffee for anyone who wants to help.
- [ ] Allow the creation of rooms to use it with friends.
- [ ] Deployment with private domain once the project finally works.
